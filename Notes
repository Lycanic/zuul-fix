On trying to implement item & people interaction features, it becomes apparent that the system would likely be best to have a complete top-down re-write, as things like the parser only taking a single word (which interferes with eg 'talk Briar mirror', and you have to assume the actions taken) force a lot of writing-round coding. This stuff could be fixed, but it would take time and a lot of prior planning which I do not have time for currently. Also, I am not sure whether I could implement the speech within the Person classes rather than in the Game class, as they often have conditionals based on the items the player/person has which are varient in number and unique to the Person made.

New plan would be to have person/NPC contain 'triggers', ie maps which check conditions and generate statements. The input and checking of triggers would need to be varied though - for example, with sending item list in (which also increases coupling) and checking for what the player has, or check what Person has, etc.
